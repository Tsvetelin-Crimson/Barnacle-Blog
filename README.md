# How to run the project
You will need 2 consoles open on the base of the project (where this file is).
- On one console run: ``` npm run start ```. This will run the frontend aka Angular.
- On the second console run: ``` npm run startBE ```. This will run the backend (Node.js in this case)

The route for he front end is http://localhost:4200/.
For the backend is http://localhost:3000/.

You can check the file under [the endpoints](src/constants/endpoints.ts) for the endpoints if you need them.
